# Harvest Finance

The history of agriculture has been marked by technological advancements that allowed human populations to scale by maximizing the available yield through better tools and crop selection. We evolved from using primitive tools like the yoke to advanced machines like the tractor, which allowed humans to maximize yield and scale our population to billions. :ear_of_rice:

With that, we present Harvest :tractor:, a tool that helps farmers of all shapes and sizes get automatic exposure to the highest yield available across select decentralized finance protocols.

Bread for the people!
