## Audits

**Haechi:** We acquired an [audit from Haechi](https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/blob/master/audits/Haechi-Harvest.pdf) which should assure our farmers that their crops are safe and bread for the people will be produced, no matter what the future brings. The audit highlighted one issue classified as major (initially pointed out by the community, thus it is already fixed), and 5 additional minor issues, 4 of which are in fact decentralization features and design choices that we actively made for our platform. The one remaining minor issue was fixed as well. We would like to thank Haechi for their hard work on this audit and keeping our farmers safe.

**PeckShield:** We acquired an [audit from PeckShield](https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/blob/master/audits/PeckShield-Harvest.pdf) which should assure our farmers that their crops are safe and bread for the people will be produced, no matter what the future brings. The main issue pointed out by PeckShield is the privileged role of our 0xf00d deployer address. Based on the discussion with our community, we have implemented timelock mechanisms that provide the farmers with an opportunity to leave the farm if they disagree with the deployer's actions before these actions are executed. An additional issue related to CRVStrategyStable's depositArbCheck() was pointed out by our wonderful community and was already fixed before the report by PeckShield was completed. Other non-informational issues do not affect the system, or are explicit design choices and decentralization features made by our team. We would like to thank PeckShield for their hard work on this audit and keeping our farmers safe.

**CertiK:** We acquired an [audit from CertiK](https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/blob/master/audits/CertiK-Harvest.pdf) which should assure our farmers that their crops are safe and bread for the people will be produced, no matter what the future brings. CertiK pointed out one minor severity issue which was classified as a false positive as the deployment and configuration does not allows for the described scenario to occur. The remainder of the findings are optimizations and language-level alternatives that do not affect the security of the system. We would like to thank CertiK for their hard work on this audit and keeping our farmers safe.

**Least Authority:** We acquired an [audit from Least Authority](https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/blob/master/audits/LeastAuthority-Harvest.pdf) which should assure our farmers that their crops are safe and bread for the people will be produced, no matter what the future brings. Least Authority did not identify issues other than the previously known ones and issues that have been already fixed. Least Authority also reviewed the intended vault re-design suggested by the Harvest team, and was helpful for determining the future direction. We would like to thank Least Authority for their hard work on this audit and keeping our farmers safe.
